       "['The article discusses the passing of the new Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan by its parliament before the July 7, 2011 deadline. The new Constitution includes the creation of a new country called the Republic of South Sudan, with its own coat of arms, national flag, motto, central bank, currency, and national anthem. It also highlights the right to citizenship in South Sudan and allows for dual citizenship. The new constitution also allows foreigners who have married South Sudanese citizens to apply and become citizens. The article also mentions the settlement of the border issues between the northern and southern Sudan by calling for a referendum in the contentious oil-rich Abyei region.',\n",
       " \"The article discusses the military actions taken by Khartoum in the weeks leading up to independence for the Republic of South Sudan. The article suggests that the military actions are a result of the worst elements being fully in charge, and the intense economic distress in North Sudan. The economy of North Sudan is performing very badly with a decline in oil revenues, high inflation rates, low foreign exchange reserves, and more painful cuts to the economy. Additionally, Sudan is facing a debt of over $38 billion, which will continue to drag the economy downwards unless the IMF and World Bank structure some form of debt relief. Khartoum's decision to adopt the present militaristic and threatening posture towards South Sudan represents a triumph of the worst impulses within the regime.\",\n",
       " 'The article discusses the signing of a Framework Agreement for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states between Sudan and Southern Sudan in Addis Ababa, which was welcomed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The agreement addresses border security and joint political and security arrangements, but both parties are urged to conclude and implement a cessation of hostilities pact. The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sudan (UNMIS) will stop operating in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile as of 9 July if an agreement on the cessation of hostilities is not reached. The humanitarian situation and the plight of vulnerable civilians in Southern Kordofan are of extreme concern, and the Government of Sudan is called upon to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those in need and that a conducive environment for humanitarian operations is created.',\n",
       " 'The article discusses the upcoming independence of South Sudan and the challenges the new state will face, including the need for a national army and police force and the resettlement of refugees. It also explores the history and tensions behind the secessionist war and the strained relationship between North and South Sudan. The article mentions specific locations such as Khartoum, Sudan, the Nile Valley, and notes a comparison to the birth of Bangladesh.',\n",
       " 'The article discusses the need for South Sudan to attract direct foreign investment in order to improve infrastructure development and service delivery after independence. The Vice President aims to mobilise up to 500 billion dollars worth of investment over the next five years to bring the new nation up to international standards in terms of infrastructure. The article also mentions the passing of both the Investment Promotion Act Bill 2011 and the Taxation Act Bill 2011 in order to make the environment more conducive for potential investors. However, ongoing insecurity is listed as one of the issues that need to be tackled in order to make South Sudan more attractive for investments.  ',\n",
       " \"The article discusses the United States' response to the July 4 meeting between Sudanese President Bashir and First Vice President Kiir at the Extraordinary Session of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development on Sudan in Addis Ababa. The US is encouraged by the meeting and welcomes the commitment of Sudan's leaders to continue negotiations on outstanding issues following South Sudan's independence on July 9. However, the US urges the parties to set a firm deadline for the resolution of these issues, as leaving them unresolved risks undermining the prospects for a positive and cooperative future relationship between Sudan and South Sudan. The article also highlights the ongoing work of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel in facilitating discussions between Sudanese leaders and raises concerns about several critical outstanding issues that remain unresolved, including questions relating to the oil sector and the final status of Abyei.\",\n",
       " \"The article discusses the recent independence of South Sudan from the Islamic north, the displacement of refugees and violence in disputed oil-rich areas across borders, the struggle for education and work opportunities and the reluctance of refugees to return to their war-stricken home country. The article also highlights the recent violence in Sudan, particularly in Abyei, Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan, where there have been ethnically targeted attacks and resistance against the government's disarmament of rebels.\",\n",
       " \"The article discusses the suspension of commercial flights from Entebbe to Juba for two days due to the Independence Day celebrations in South Sudan. The closure of Juba Airport affects over 10 airlines and trade between Uganda and South Sudan. The celebrations will take place in Juba, where a declaration of independence is to be signed on Saturday, giving birth to the world's 196th nation, the Republic of Southern Sudan. Security measures are in place to ensure peaceful celebrations.\",\n",
       " \"The article discusses the Elders' letter of congratulations to President Salva Kiir Mayardit ahead of South Sudan's secession from Sudan on 9 July. They urge the new government to foster harmonious relations with Khartoum, adopt an inclusive approach to governance, and avoid actions that could provoke further violence in Abyei and Southern Kordofan.\",\n",
       " 'The article discusses the history of Sudan and the oppression of Africans in the North by Arabs, leading to the fight for self-determination and independence. The people of Southern Sudan voted for independence and will become the youngest Republic in Africa on July 9, 2011. The article emphasizes the need to build a nation that values ethno-linguistic diversities and protects the civil, economic, political, social, cultural, and ecological rights of its citizens. The pioneer leaders are encouraged to establish a correct system and hand over to a new generation after one term.',\n",
       " \"The article discusses a mock parade conducted in Juba, South Sudan, a week before the region's official separation from the rest of Sudan and becoming independent on July 9. The parade involved various organised forces including the army, police, civil society groups, cultural dancers, and civilians. The event took place at the mausoleum of late John Garang and was attended by the region's Vice President, Riek Machar Teny, and a number of ministers, MPs as well as senior officers in the military and police. The region is due to become the 54th country in Africa and 193rd in the world after its formal independence from the rest of Sudan on July 9 and is expected to be attended by 25 heads of state including the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon.\",\n",
       " \"The article discusses the South Sudan government's plan to classify hotels in Juba that will soon host foreign dignitaries for the country's independence celebrations. The classification aims to meet international standards and ensure improved hygienic conditions. Hotels who charge high fees risk having their properties assessed and downgraded if they do not conform to internationally acceptable standards. The assessment involves a number of factors that include professionalism among service providers, the degree of privacy, the drainage and sewage treatment systems, environmental friendliness of the facility, and the administrative structure. The government of South Sudan, in collaboration with the Juba town council, Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Housing, is carrying out the assessment to classify hotels meeting international standards and find out hygienic conditions of all hotels operating in Juba.\",\n",

Payne being a member of the Presidential Delegation to attend the ceremony marking the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of South Sudan to be held in the Republic of Sudan. Congressman Payne expresses his privilege to be representing the United States of America at the event, and talks about his past involvement in helping Sudan achieve peace and justice. He highlights that South Sudan will become the 196th country in the world, the 193rd member of the UN and the 55th country in Africa.',\n",
       " 'The article discusses the preparations for South Sudan to attain independence, with a focus on strengthening foreign policies with countries that have recognized its independence.

The article also mentions South Sudan's impending independence, issues with oil-rights sharing with North Sudan, and discussions about building a pipeline to connect to the existing pipeline running from Mombasa to Eldoret in Kenya. The article suggests that the South Sudanese government is considering alternative options if negotiations with the North do not resolve issues surrounding oil.\",\n",
       " 'The article discusses the preparations of the United Nations for the independence of South Sudan, which was born out of a UN-backed peace process that ended the north-south Sudanese civil war. The article mentions that a new UN mission is expected to take the place of the peacekeeping operation of UNMIS, which is set to expire on the day of the celebrations. The United Nations Security Council is expected to vote on the form and shape of the new operation later in the week. The article also mentions concerns raised by UN humanitarian agencies about the difficult conditions of southerners stranded in the north and the existence of hotspots in South Sudan, areas where inter-communal violence, ethnic clashes, and active military insurgencies are taking place.',\n",
       " \"The article discusses the warning issued by senior U.S. officials that unresolved issues between South Sudan and Khartoum, including the status of Abyei and allocation of oil revenues, as well as conflicts along their common border, threaten the stability of both states. The failure to resolve these issues could destabilize the future relationships between the two states.
