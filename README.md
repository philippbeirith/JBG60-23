# South Sudan Project 
## Code description
This repository contains all the data, dashboards, models, grouping methods, and other supporting code used to create the presentation poster. Most noble files are:
- GPT Topic Modeling.ipynb
- weather_grouping.ipynb
- bertopic_merge.py
- forecasting.py
This 'forecasting.py' is the final step, it runs the model based on all processed data.

## Requirements
To install the requirements open Terminal (macOS)/Command Prompt (Windows) and run pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the notebooks, try the following:
- check that you have all the necessary libraries installed and the correct versions of them
- check your Python version. In principle, the code should work with any Python versions higher than 3.9.16. If this is not the case, create a virtual environment that uses Python 3.9.16.
